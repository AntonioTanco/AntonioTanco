<h1>Hi 👋🏻, I'm Antonio: <br/></h1>

🌱 I’m currently learning the in's and out's of System Administration. IT is not only a passion for me but I actively teach myself programming as a hobby. The projects I tend to create are custom solutions stemming from real world experiences I've seen first hand from working in the IT Industry.

<h4> ⚙️ In the works:</h4>

🔭 I’m currently working on a project which programmatically solves an issue I've constantly seen occur in ALL the IT environments I've worked in so far. I'm working on creating a Backend application that can dynamically store, check and validate users login sessions against their assigned assets programmically using Python in hopes of streamlining the Asset Management Lifecycle process for all.

You can follow this project here @ [Asset Management Project](https://github.com/AntonioTanco/FastAPI-GraphQL-Asset-Management)
